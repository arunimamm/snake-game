# snake-game
A game built in python using Tkinter  which resembles the old game called 'Blockade. 
In this game,  player have to use the arrow keys to move the 'snake' around the screen.
As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. 
The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. 
The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens and the final score will be displayed.
